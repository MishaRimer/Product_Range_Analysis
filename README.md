# Projects Description

| Project | Description | Libraries |
| ------- | ----------- | --------- |
| [Product Range Analysis](https://github.com/MishaRimer/Product_Range_Analysis/blob/main/Project_Product_Range.ipynb) | Analyzed transaction history of a household goods store to determine customer demand patterns and product popularity. Recommendations for product range and inventory optimization were made to enhance store performance. Outcomes included: product categorization, preference and seasonality analysis, basket analysis, RFM scoring-based product segmentation, and creation of a Tableau dashboard for visual insights | pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, re, nltk, sklearn, mlxtend math, scipy | 
| [AB_test_conversion](https://github.com/MishaRimer/Python_Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Project_AB_test.ipynb) | Tested the hypothesis that the improved recommendation system positively impacted user behavior and increased conversion | pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, math, scipy |
| [Forecast & Predictions](https://github.com/MishaRimer/Python_Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Forecasts%20%26%20Predictions_Gym%20Chain.ipynb) | Machine learning was applied to predict churn of gym chain customers. The project involved creating user portraits, determining factors influencing churn, and suggesting enhancements to customer service, all to ultimately reduce customer churn | pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodels, scipy |
