# Projects Description

| Project | Description | Libraries |
| ------- | ----------- | --------- |
| [Product Range Analysis](https://github.com/MishaRimer/Product_Range_Analysis/blob/main/Project_Product_Range.ipynb) | Analyzed a household goods store's transaction history, revealing customer demand patterns and product popularity. The analysis, based on sales data and customer feedback, informed recommendations for optimizing the product range and inventory.  Outcomes included: product categorization, in-depth preference and seasonality analysis, basket analysis and RFM scoring for product segmentation. Additionally, a Tableau dashboard was developed, providing visual insights and aiding in the tracking of performance metrics.| pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, re, nltk, sklearn, mlxtend math, scipy | 
| [AB_test_conversion](https://github.com/MishaRimer/Python_Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Project_AB_test.ipynb) | Tested the hypothesis that enhancements to recommendation system would positively impact user behavior, increasing conversion rates. To validate this, an A/B test was conducted, comparing user interactions and conversion rates between the enhanced system and the previous version. This approach aimed to objectively measure the system's effectiveness in improving user experience and driving sales. | pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, math, scipy |
| [Forecast & Predictions](https://github.com/MishaRimer/Python_Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Forecasts%20%26%20Predictions_Gym%20Chain.ipynb) |Applied machine learning techniques, specifically [logistic regression, random forest], to predict customer churn in a gym chain. This project entailed developing detailed user portraits using data such as demographics and usage patterns. We also identified key factors influencing churn, like attendance frequency and membership tenure. Based on these insights, we proposed targeted enhancements to customer service to proactively address churn risks | pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodels, scipy |
| [User Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/MishaRimer/Python_Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/User_behavior_food_app.ipynb) | Investigated user behavior within a food product application, with a focus on analyzing the sales funnel to comprehend user navigation patterns leading to purchases. This involved scrutinizing event logs to determine event frequencies, the average number of events per user, and the timeframe of the data. These events included user interactions such as clicks and page views. In parallel,   A/A/B test was conducted to assess the impact of a proposed font change in the app's design, providing a comparison to validate the effectiveness of this design modification | pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, scipy |
| [Market Analysis](https://github.com/MishaRimer/Python_Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Market%20Analysis_Restaurants_LA.ipynb) | Conducted market analysis for launching a cafe in Los Angeles, utilizing open-source data. The study entailed evaluating different types of establishments, examining chain prevalence and analyzing average seating capacities.  Geographical analysis of restaurant distribution was also perforemed, focusing on street-level trends to identify potential market gaps. The conclusion were used in guiding decisions for the proposed restaurant. | pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, re|
